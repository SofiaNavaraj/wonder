	<h1>Ajax Tab Panel</h1>
	<h2>Works just like CCAjaxTabPanel*</h2>
	<p>* with one small difference; I put the update container around the component content instead of the whole panel so that I could use animations when replacing the content that wouldn't effect the tabs.  The tabs use a callback to make the selected tab disabled.  To style a disabled tab use this CSS rule: a[disabled] {}</p>
