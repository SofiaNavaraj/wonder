					<h1>Project Wonder jQuery Components</h1>
					<hr class = "simple" />
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						This framework is based upon the original Ajax framework for Project Wonder.  
						There are some major differences besides the obvious one (we are using the JQuery JavaScript framework in place of the Prototype.js framework).  
						Unlike the original framwork we are going to use the "data" attribute in place of putting JavaScript on the page.
						This presents some different opportunities and challenges.
					</p>
					<h3>Object Initialization</h3>
					<p>
						When the page loads or when a page fragment gets returned from an Ajax request a JavaScript function is called.  
						The function will use a "selector" to find all the HTML elements within the document or page fragment that has an attribute named "data-wonder-id".
						The function will use the value of the attribute to decide how to initialize the element.
						This works like a factory method.
					</p>
					<h3>Object Caching</h3>
					<p>
						Some components like the AjaxUpdateContainer require a JavaScript object to be initialized.  
						To access the object associated with the component you call the method Wonder.Page.getComponent(theElementsID);  
						So if you wanted to update an AjaxUpdateContainer using JavaScript you call: Wonder.Page.getComponent(theElementID).update();  
						See the example on the AjaxUpdateLink page (onClick).  
						Because we are using the JQuery data function to store the object if the element gets removed from the page the object will automatically get deallocated.
					</p>
					<h3>Delegates</h3>
					<p>
						This is still raw and could be overhauled.  Advice would be greatly appreciated!
						When an AjaxUpdateContainer updates it's contents it goes through the following phases: 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>mightUpdate - called before the AJAX request i.e. if you want to do some sort of check before making the request - see the Form Validation page (AJAX request).</li>
						<li>willUpdate - called after the AJAX request completes but before the DOM is updated.</li>
						<li>didUpdate - is called after the DOM has been updated.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						An example of how you would use this is for animations: During willUpdate the AUC will fade out - when completed the DOM gets updated and then during didUpdate the AUC will fade back in.
						There is the additional phase, updateFailed, in the event of an error during one of the phases.
						Right now I'm using the JQuery implementation of the Promise design pattern to make sure that each phase completes before stepping into the next one. 
						You can also specify a callback which will be called after the didUpdate phase is completed.
						Look at the source of jquery.wonder.js for delegate examples.  To use a delegate just pass in the name of the delegate to the "delegate" binding of the AUC.  
						If you want to override the AUC's delegate just pass in the name of your delegate to the component that will tell the AUC to update i.e. an AjaxUpdateLink.
					</p>
					<h3>Namespace</h3>
					<p>Using this framework only introduces two variables to the window's namespace: JQuery (duh!) and Wonder.  So you shouldn't have to worry about using this framework with other JavaScript libraries.</p>
