	<h1>Project Wonder jQuery Components</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
		This framework is based upon the original Ajax framework for Project Wonder.  
		There are some major differences besides the obvious one (we are using the JQuery JavaScript framework in place of the Prototype.js framework).  
		Unlike the original framwork we are going to use the "data" attribute in place of putting JavaScript on the page.
		This presents some different opportunities and challenges.
	</p>
	<h3>Object Initialization</h3>
	<p>
		When the page loads or when a page fragment gets returned from an Ajax request a JavaScript function is called.  
		The function will use a "selector" to find all the HTML elements within the document or page fragment that has an attribute named "data-wonder-id".
		The function will use the value of the attribute to decide how to initialize the element.
		This works like a factory method.
		If the object needs to respond to a user interaction like a "click" it will need to register the event handler.
